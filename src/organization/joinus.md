# Join us!

The Open Power Quality project is looking for undergraduates and graduate students in both computer science and electrical engineering to help us create technology that supports renewable energy in Hawaii!

Are you interested in hardware?  We are currently designing, fabricating, and deploying [OPQBox2](http://openpowerquality.org/opqbox2/).  We invite your participation in all aspects of development.

Are you interested in web application development? We are currently designing and implementing [OPQView2](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opqview2), a [Meteor](meteor.com) application for user interaction with the data.

Are you interested in highly scalable systems and big data?  Come help us develop [OPQHub2](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opqhub2), a repository for power quality data.

Let us know you're interested through the [Contact](contact.html) page.
