     <h1>G1: Pipeline</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Pipeline (G1) pilot study began in mid-August, 2014 with the installation of three G1 OPQBoxes on Oahu. The three OPQBoxes were installed in three kinds of facilities: one was in a scientific laboratory building on the UH Manoa campus, one was in an apartment complex in Honolulu, and one was in a residence on the Windward side of Oahu.</p>

<p>Also at that time, an initial version of the OPQHub cloud service was deployed and began accepting data from the devices.</p>

<p>Both OPQBoxes and the OPQHub received updates during the pilot study.  The OPQBoxes were updated to better record the duration of events.  The OPQHub cloud service underwent significant redesign of its user interface. These pilot study results will refer to the latest versions of hardware and software.  In addition, one of the OPQBoxes was relocated from its Windward Oahu location to a Honolulu location during the pilot study.</p>

<p>The goals of the Pipeline Pilot Study were:</p>

<ol>
<li>To validate communication between OPQBoxes and an OPQHub.</li>
<li>To obtain preliminary, uncalibrated data about grid stability on Oahu.</li>
<li>To obtain requirements for the design of the G2 OPQBox and OPQHub.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data collection</h2>

<p>After approximately six weeks of data collection, the devices observed 8824 voltage events (i.e. voltages outside the range of 114 - 126 V, exceeding the 5% variability for normal operation established by HECO).  The devices also observed 6 frequency events (i.e. frequency fluctuation outside the range of 57 - 63 Hz).</p>

<p>All of the frequency events were less than 1 second in duration.  Only the Windward Oahu OPQBox observed frequency events. Most of the voltage events were on the order of 1 second in duration, though 190 voltage events lasted longer than 30 seconds.</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<p>We feel that all of the goals for this pilot study were met.   The OPQBoxes were able to successfully communicate with the OPQHub.  Each of the three OPQBoxes collected several thousand voltage events. Both OPQBoxes and the OPQHub appeared relatively stable.  Our results also appear to demonstrate issues with grid stability on Oahu, although the lack of calibration in the current devices means we cannot rule out device calibration error as the source of the problematic events.</p>
